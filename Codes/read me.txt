The codes here apply the theories or methods introduced in our corresponding paper. Many codes can only be run by MAPLE. If Maple is not installed on your computer, please refer to the website https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/. You can download this software there. If you don't want to go too far, please follow the ideas in our paper and implement our theoretical methods on other software to achieve the expected results. After all, our paper aims more to bring methodological and theoretical innovation to readers, rather than at the computer level, because even for a program, the computational efficiency obtained by different computers may vary. 
Of course, if you have any questions, you can contact me via email at guolaigang@gmail.com.
